Assignment: Login and Registration
Objectives:
Build a login and registration page with validations
Practice Flash messages
Practice session
It's time to build Login and Registration again, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.

Registration should adhere to the following guidelines:

First Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Last Name - required; at least 2 characters; letters only
Email - required; valid format
Password - required; at least 8 characters; matches password confirmation
login_reg

Something to Consider
User.objects.get(email = email)

If there is not a matching email for a .get(), Django throws an error (try and except could come in handy), otherwise it returns the User object associated with the matching user. e.g. Userobject.

User.objects.filter(email = email)

Filter, on the other hand, returns a list, so if there is no user that matches, it returns an empty list. If there is a single matching user the list will contain a single User object: e.g. [Userobject].

 Create a new Django project with a login app
 Have the root route render a page where users can register or log in
 Complete the registration method, including showing errors if the input is invalid
 Complete the login method, including showing errors if the input is invalid
 Upon successful registration or login, redirect to a success page, displaying the user's name and a message as shown above
 Have the logout link clear the session and redirect to the login/reg page
 Don't allow a user who is not logged in to reach the /success route (i.e. by making a GET request in the address bar)
 NINJA BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user's birthday is in the past
 NINJA BONUS: Validate that the email provided for registration is unique
 SENSEI BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user is at least 13 years old (COPPA compliant!)
 SENSEI BONUS: Validate the email uniqueness with AJAX
 SENSEI BONUS: Use JavaScript to perform client-side validations
 SENSEI BONUS: In addition to server side validations, use JavaScript to perform client-side validations on required fields. Don't allow the form to be submitted unless fields are valid.
